# router-restart

A simple GUI python application to restart wifi-routers without leaving your couch.

It connects to the router via wifi, using Selenium and Chrome/Firefox WebDrivers with headless options enabled.
The application logs in and issues the reboot command.

It's quite specific and works only if you have Thomson and DIR wifi-routers. Most likely it's not gonna work for you unless you modify the code.
